# Typing Speed Test Application

This project is a **Typing Speed Test** application built using **Streamlit**. The application allows users to test their typing speed, accuracy, and correctness while providing visual feedback and performance metrics.

## Features

1. **Typing Test**:
   - Users type a randomly selected paragraph from a predefined list.
   - Real-time tracking of words typed, speed, and accuracy.

2. **Feedback**:
   - Character-by-character feedback on the typed text.
   - **Green**: Correct characters.
   - **Red**: Incorrect characters.
   - **Gray**: Missing characters (not typed).

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Calculates the speed of typing.
   - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters compared to the total.
   - **Incorrect Words**: Count of words typed incorrectly.

4. **Charts and Visualizations**:
   - Bar chart showing WPM and accuracy.
   - Line chart simulating typing speed progression over time.
   - Pie chart representing character correctness distribution.

5. **Containerized Deployment**:
   - The project is containerized for easy deployment in any environment.
   - Simply pull and run the Docker container to get started.

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - The app is designed to work across devices with an interactive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **Python**: Core programming language for logic and data processing.
- **Altair**: For creating interactive charts.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
